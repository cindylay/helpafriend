# Help A Friend
For our final project, we wanted to create a theoretical solution to Homelessness by creating an marketplace app for part-time jobs.

Using MongoDB, Handlebars, HTML, and CSS we built a web app for potential employees and employers to communicate.
Employers can post jobs offers and employees can view the jobs that have been posted and fill out a form to apply

The app demo was hosted on Heroku at https://murmuring-dawn-35157.herokuapp.com/, however there aren't currently issues deploying since the app has not been maintained since August 2017.

The following video is a small demo of how the app used to look:
